Imagine if we could auto scale simply by wrapping any existing app code in a function and have that block of code run in a temporary copy of the app.

Enter the FLAME pattern.

> FLAME - Fleeting Lambda Application for Modular Execution

With FLAME, you treat your *entire application* as a lambda, where modular parts can be executed on short-lived infrastructure.

Check the screencast to see it in action:

You can wrap any block of code in a `FLAME.call` and it will find or boot a copy of the app, execute the work there, and return the results:

```elixir
def generate_thumbnails(%Video{} = vid, interval) do
  FLAME.call(MyApp.FFMpegRunner, fn ->
    # I'm runner on a short-lived, temporary server
    tmp_dir = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), Ecto.UUID.generate())
    File.mkdir!(tmp_dir)
    System.cmd("ffmpeg", ~w(-i #{vid.url} -vf fps=1/#{interval} #{tmp_dir}/%02d.png))
    urls = VideoStore.put_thumbnails(vid, Path.wildcard(tmp_dir <> "/*.png"))
    Repo.insert_all(Thumbnail, Enum.map(urls, &%{video_id: vid.id, url: url}))
  end)
end
```

Here we wrapped up our CPU expensive `ffmpeg` operation in a `FLAME.call/2`. FLAME accepts a function and any variables that the function closes over. In this example, the `%Video{}` struct and `interval` are passed along automatically. The work happens in a temporary copy of the app. We can do any work inside the FLAME call because we are running the *entire application*, database connection(s) and all.

`FLAME` provides the following interfaces for elastically scaled operations:
  * `FLAME.call/2` - used for synchronous calls
  * `FLAME.cast/2` - used for async casts where you don't need to wait on the results
  * `FLAME.place_child/3` â€“ used for placing a child spec somewhere to run, in place of `DynamicSupervisor.start_child`, `Task.Supervisor.start_child`, etc

The `FLAME.Pool` handles elastically scaling runners up and down, as well as remote monitoring of resources. Check the moduledoc for example usage.
